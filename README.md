Nidhi Portfolio - Next.js (converted)

Run locally:

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Notes:
- This project keeps the original CSS extracted from the uploaded Framer HTML.
- Sections are split into modular components that render the original HTML via dangerouslySetInnerHTML.
- framer-motion is included for section animations.
- Verify paths to images/fonts in globals.css; external Framer CDN links remain intact.
